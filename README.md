# HomieBot

This bot was developed in order to learn Python while also making a fun (and sometimes rude) bot for Discord servers. 

Sadly, due to recent changes in the way Discord handles bots, production of this bot has stopped.

-- Features that were working included --

Saving and loading from private database.

JSON read and write after pulling from collection

User Profiles which were saved to database including any name, picture/gif, and other information the user chose to save.

Games (Math wizard, Battle system, etc.)
